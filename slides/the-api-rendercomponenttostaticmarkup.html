<h2>React . renderComponentToStaticMarkup</h2>

    <code>
        string renderComponentToStaticMarkup(ReactComponent component)

Similar to renderComponentToString, except this doesn't create extra DOM attributes such as data-react-id, that React uses internally. This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static page generator, as stripping away the extra attributes can save lots of bytes.</aside>
