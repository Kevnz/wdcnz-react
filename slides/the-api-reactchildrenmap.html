<h2>React.Children.map</h2>

<pre>
    <code>
object React.Children.map(object children, function fn [, object context])
    </code>
</pre>
<aside class="notes">
    Invoke fn on every immediate child contained within children with this set to context. If children is a nested object or array it will be traversed: fn will never be passed the container objects. If children is null or undefined returns null or undefined rather than an empty object.
